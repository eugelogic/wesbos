        Hey! I get lots of email, so please scan this page before firing one
        off. Don't be afraid to email me, it just might take a few days (or
        weeks) for me to get back to you ðŸ˜ƒ.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>If you want me to work for you</strong>, I am not accepting any
        client work at the moment, but I'd recommend you{' '}

        </a>{' '}
        - they are great!

        , all that info is available on my <a href="/uses">/uses</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>If you are a recruiter</strong>, I love you, but please donâ€™t
        call or email me ðŸ™‚. I'm also not able to help you find someone for your
        position.

        <strong>If you want career or development advice</strong>, I'm happy to
        help as best I can. I prefer you submit it as a potluck question on{' '}
        <a href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax.fm</a> so the greater community can
        benefit, but I'll still try answer if you want to privately!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I will absolutely take your free stuff</strong>. If you want to
        send me a sticker, tshirt (large), hot sauce or honda civic. I can't
        promise I'll share or talk about your thing, but if it's cool I likely
        will!
